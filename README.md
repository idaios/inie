Inherited and non-inherited evolution

This project performs forward in time simulations of a population. The main idea is that an individual has a series of properties that normally are not inherited. With some probability this value is transmitted to its offsprings. Now, it's possible that the well being of an individual and thus, the ability to multiply itself is affected by a number of factors, some non genetical are also part of this. I would like to know how much genetical and non-genetical factors affect the patterns of polymorphisms.
